# PrivacyPolicy

## share data

We will never share your data with anyone.

## cloud chats

Thongsin is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents in cloud chat on our servers so you can access your data anytime from any device and use our instant server search to quickly access your messages from behind. All data is stored highly encrypted, and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in different jurisdictions. This way, user data cannot be accessed by local engineers or physical intruders.

## chats

Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption. This means all data is encrypted with a key known only to you and your chat buddies. There is no way for us or anyone else to know what is being sent in these messages without having direct access to your device. We do not save your secret chats on our servers. We also don't keep any message logs in Secret Chats, so after a short period of time we have no way of knowing who or when you messaged via Secret Chats. For the same reason, secret chats aren't available in Cloud Chat -- you can only access those messages from the device from which they were sent.

## Media in private chats

When you send photos, videos, or files via Secret Chat, each item is encrypted with a separate key unknown to the server before uploading. This key and the location of the file are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat key, which will also be sent to your chat buddies. He can download and decrypt the file. This means that, technically, the file is on one of Thongsin's servers, but it looks like random, undecipherable junk to anyone but you and your chat buddies. We don't know what this random data represents, we don't know which specific chat it belongs to. We periodically clear this random data from our servers to save disk space.

## contact person

Thongsin uses phone numbers as unique identifiers, so you can easily switch from other messaging apps (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) and keep your social graph. We will ask for your permission before syncing your contacts. We store your contacts so that you can be notified when one of your contacts signs up for Thongsin, and the name is displayed correctly in the notification. We only need numbers and names, no other data about your contacts is stored.

## email address

After enabling 2-step verification for your account, you have the option to set up a password recovery email. This address is only used to send you your password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or "we miss you" crap.

## information

Everything you delete will be permanently deleted. Except cats. We won't delete funny cat pictures, we love them too much. When you delete a message, it is removed from your message history. This means that a copy is still kept on the server as part of the partner's message history. Once your friends delete it too, it's gone forever. Thongsin's goal is not to make a profit, we take disk space on our servers very seriously.

## self destruct message

Messages in secret chats can be designated to self-destruct. As soon as such a message is read (2 checks occur), the countdown starts. When the time is up, both devices participating in the secret chat will delete the message (photo, video, etc.).

## destroy account

If you stop using Thongsin and do not log in to Thongsin for 6 months, your account will be deleted, as will all your messages, media, contacts and all other data stored in the Thongsin cloud. You can change the exact self-destruct period for inactive accounts in Settings.
